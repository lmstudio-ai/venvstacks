Fixed
-----

- Layer lock metadata generated by versions prior to 0.5.0 is now accepted as valid
  as long as the locked requirements file hasn't changed (resolved in :pr:`187`).
- Resetting runtime and framework layer locks no longer prevents locking layers that
  depend on the affected layers (resolved in :pr:`187`).
