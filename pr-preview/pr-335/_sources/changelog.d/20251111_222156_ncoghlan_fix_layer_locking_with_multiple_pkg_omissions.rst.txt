- Resolved a number of issues related to incorrect layer dependency filtering
  for different combinations of environment markers, layer target platforms,
  and package provenance details (initial problem reported in :issue:`333`,
  additional issues found when updating the test suite to ensure the example
  stacks are producing the expected layer lock and package summary details).
