# Contributing to `venvstacks`

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to `venvstacks`!
There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them.

While `venvstacks` is not a Python Packaging Authority project, it is nevertheless
part of the Python packaging ecosystem, and hence likely to be discussed in
PyPA-managed communication channels. All contributors are expected to abide by the
[PyPA Code of Conduct][pypa-coc].

## Communication

- **The best way to communicate with the team is to open an issue in this repository**
- For bug reports, include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
- For feature requests, explain the use case and benefits clearly

For general `venvstacks` discussion (not specific to its use in LM Studio), there is a
`#venvstacks` channel within the [PyPA Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pypa).

## Before You Contribute

- **If you find an existing issue you'd like to work on, please comment on it first and tag the team**
- This allows us to provide guidance and ensures your time is well spent
- **We discourage drive-by feature PRs** without prior discussion - we want to make sure your efforts align with our roadmap and won't go to waste

If you are planning to add a feature,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/venvstacks/issues) first to discuss it.
This is mainly to avoid duplicate work and to make sure that your contribution is in line
with the project's goals,
so please check if there is an existing issue before filling a new one.
